# Answer:
# Use Z-test when population SD is known or n > 30.
# Use T-test when population SD is unknown and n < 30.
# Example:
# One-sample t-test (manually checking if sample mean â‰  known mean)
import scipy.stats as stats
sample = [15, 17, 14, 16, 18]
t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_1samp(sample, 16)
print("T-Statistic:", t_stat)
print("P-value:", p_value)
