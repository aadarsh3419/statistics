**Topic:** T-Test  
**Question:** A sample of 20 students has an average score of 75. The population mean is 80, and standard deviation is 10. Is there a significant difference?  
**Answer:**  
n = 20  
x̄ = 75, μ = 80, s = 10  
t = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n) = (75 - 80) / (10 / √20) = -2.24  
Compare with t-critical value (α = 0.05): ±2.093  
Since -2.24 < -2.093 → Reject null hypothesis  
There is significant difference.
