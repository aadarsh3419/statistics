**Topic:** ANOVA  
**Question:** Test if the means of 3 groups are significantly different:  
Group A: [5, 7, 6]  
Group B: [8, 9, 7]  
Group C: [6, 5, 7]  

**Answer (Python code used):**
```python
from scipy.stats import f_oneway
group_a = [5, 7, 6]
group_b = [8, 9, 7]
group_c = [6, 5, 7]
f_stat, p_value = f_oneway(group_a, group_b, group_c)
print(f"F = {f_stat}, p = {p_value}")
