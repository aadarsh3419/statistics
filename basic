Topic: Central Tendency â€“ Mean, Median, Mode

Self-Practice Notes

I took a small dataset of student marks and tried to calculate mean, median, and mode manually and using Python to reinforce the concept.

import numpy as np
from scipy import stats

# Sample data: Marks of 10 students in a test
marks = [45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 55, 70, 75, 55, 80]

# Mean
mean_marks = np.mean(marks)
print(f"Mean: {mean_marks}")

# Median
median_marks = np.median(marks)
print(f"Median: {median_marks}")

# Mode
mode_marks = stats.mode(marks, keepdims=False)
print(f"Mode: {mode_marks.mode}, Count: {mode_marks.count}")
