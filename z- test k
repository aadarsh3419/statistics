 Z-test to compare sample mean and population mean (known std)
import numpy as np
from scipy import stats


sample_mean = 49.2
population_mean = 50
std_dev = 1.5
sample_size = 40

 Calculate Standard Error (SE)
se = std_dev / np.sqrt(sample_size)

 Calculate Z-score
z_score = (sample_mean - population_mean) / se

 Calculate p-value
p_value = stats.norm.sf(abs(z_score)) * 2  # two-tailed

print("Z-Score:", z_score)
print("P-Value:", p_value)

 Conclusion
if p_value < 0.05:
    print("→ Reject null hypothesis: Output mean is significantly different.")
else:
    print("→ Fail to reject null: No significant difference.")
