## 🧑‍💻 Sample Python Code – Bayes Theorem

```python
# Given values
P_D = 0.02          # P(Disease)
P_not_D = 0.98      # P(No Disease)
P_Pos_given_D = 0.90        # P(Positive | Disease)
P_Pos_given_not_D = 0.05    # P(Positive | No Disease)

# Bayes Theorem
numerator = P_Pos_given_D * P_D
denominator = (P_Pos_given_D * P_D) + (P_Pos_given_not_D * P_not_D)
P_D_given_Pos = numerator / denominator

print("P(Disease | Positive):", round(P_D_given_Pos, 4))
